README: good!
  I would have directly wrote an example. Also, be aware of the formatting of the markdown. You could have presented the bash string to run the code a bit better.
  There are also many typos, and the text is sometimes confusing.

Code quality:
  Please give a more significant name to the problem obj: P is not very explicit.

  I don't like the division between sequential and parallel solver.
  I don't like the fact that you are passing the number of threads to the constructor. Why? You have so many ways to set them. This is a mistake :)
  The proper way is to use the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, or to pass it with -x OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 at runtime.

  (useless observation: why is every written avery in the comments? :D)
  (useless observation: why sometimes some methods are nnnNnn and sometimes NnnNnn? Be consistent)

test:
  test should not compile the executable, but only use it.
  Performance are good with only MPI. Nice job!
